# 3D-Eddy-segmentation
Rutgers University &amp; Ozyegin University Eddy segmentation
This is a project by Rutgers University and Ozyegin University

The project is aiming at deep learning on 3D eddy segmentation

You need to change the dataset file to make it work. (Sorry I don't have more bandwith to upload big file to Github)

Manual:
1. Download the dataset and the code file
2. Unzip the dataset
3. change the name of the directory of the dataset to "data4test"
4. change the name of sub-folder
    a) "fineTuneData" to "data"
    b) "fineTuneLabel" to "label"
5. See if you need to mount any drive or something
6. It should work now
7. Each epoch should give some output image to evaluate the result
